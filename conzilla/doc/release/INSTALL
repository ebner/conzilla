Installing Conzilla consists of a couple of steps, follow them and
there will be no problems.

1) If you doesn't have a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) you need to 
   download one.
   (Observe that on unix systems usually a java installation already exist, 
    contact your systemadministrator or just someone able to answear your 
    questions.)
   To download go to http://java.sun.com/ and choose some version higher 
   than 1.2.2. (It's enough with a JRE, a JDK is bigger and for developers.)
   The bundle is approximately *** MB in size, so brace yourself if you are
   on a slow connection.
   Follow the installation instructions for the JRE.

   Note: remember the install-location (JAVAHOME) in your filesystem, 
         it may come in handy later on.

2) Download the file Conzilla.jar from the same place you got this 
   document. Put it somewhere suitable in your filesystem.
   
3) Adjust the file which launches conzilla, here I assume it is in 
   the same directory as Conzilla.jar.
   Schematically it looks like this:

   java  -classpath Conzilla.jar se.kth.cid.conzilla.app.ConzillaApp $1

   (On unix systems you have a row on top saying
    #! /bin/sh
    this just defines wich environment Conzilla is run in.)

   If this doesn't work try to execute the command 
   java 
   in some shell, (like bash on unix, msdos on windows)
   If this terminates with somenthing like 
   java: command not found:
   you have to give the path to the java-runnable.
   Now it's time to remember where you installed your java environment.
   So instead of the plain 'java' in the row above you put
   'path-to-java-environment/bin/java'

   So lets give two examples of the most common platforms:
   ******************windows example********************
   *******************unix example**********************
   #!/bin/bash

   /usr/local/jdk1.2.2/bin/java  -classpath Conzilla.jar \
                    se.kth.cid.conzilla.app.ConzillaApp $1

4) Run the launch file from 3).
   (On unix systems you may have to change permissions on the
    file so it can be executed, i.e.
    chmod +x conzilla
    and then try again.)
   
   Hopefully you will now see a window saying:
   'Conzilla does not seem to be installed on your account.'
   And some more information, accept by pressing 'Yes, install'
   Now a Install-log will show you what happens.
   Just press the 'Start!' button to start.

5) Have fun, and read the document GettingStarted or the
   tutorial if you don't know your way around.
