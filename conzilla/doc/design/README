How to generate the docs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This file describes what is needed to correctly generate the Conzilla
DocBook docs. This is still much too complicated, but the widening adoption
of DocBook should make this easier in the not too distant future.


----- Needed installation -------

* The SP toolkit (with nsgmls) for XML validation.
* Jade and JadeTeX.
* The DocBook 4.0 XML DTD.
* Norman Walsh's Modular DocBook stylesheets.
* A file with the SGML declaration for XML. Usually contained in the jade
  distribution.



----- Needed configuration -------

* Environment variable SGML_CATALOG_FILES pointing to at least the
  Modular Stylesheets and docbook DTD respective catalogs. An example:

  SGML_CATALOG_FILES=/usr/local/share/sgml/modular_stylesheets4.0/catalog:/usr/local/share/sgml/docbookXML4.0/docbookx.cat

* A file 'catalog' in this directory to point to the SGML declaration for XML.
  Example: 

  SGMLDECL /usr/lib/sgml/xml.dcl

  This is needed by jade as the stylesheets are SGML but the document XML...
  Do *not* use SGMLTools (or the 'lite' version). They will not use this file,
  and jade will thus fail.





----- Make targets -------

* ps      -- creates conzilla-design.ps in out/
* onehtml -- creates conzilla-design.html in out/
* html    -- creates a lot of files in out/conzilla-design/





----- XEmacs configuration -------

* Try the following with a recent version of PSGML:

  ;; XML
  (setq auto-mode-alist (append auto-mode-alist '(("\\.xml$" . xml-mode))))
  
  ;; SGML
  (add-hook 'sgml-mode-hook '(lambda () (auto-fill-mode)
  	  (font-lock-mode)
  	  (require 'cc-mode)
  	  (define-key sgml-mode-map '(return) 'reindent-then-newline-and-indent)
  	  (define-key sgml-mode-map '(backspace) 'c-electric-backspace)
  	  (define-key sgml-mode-map '(delete) 'c-electric-delete)))
  
  (custom-set-variables
   '(sgml-indent-data t t)
   '(sgml-set-face t)
   '(sgml-insert-missing-element-comment nil)
   '(sgml-insert-end-tag-on-new-line nil)
   '(sgml-auto-activate-dtd nil))

* Save the loaded DTD in docbookx.ced (Hint: The "DTD" menu).





----- Problems -------

I have changed the following in the stylesheet files:

* Comment -> Remark to support DocBooc 4.0. Files: dbblock.dsl and
  dbfootn.dsl

* "Chapter %n" to "Chapter %n, %t" in dbl1en.dsl 

Everything else has been customized in the stylesheets used by the Makefile.


----- SGMLTools lite -------

Does not (yet) work. But:

Leave the catalog file with the XML DTD, and symlink to it 
from /etc/sgml/catalog.d. After you've ran gensgmlenv and 
reloaded /etc/sgml/sgml.env, you'll be able to process DocBk documents.

Good luck!
