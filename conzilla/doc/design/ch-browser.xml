      <para>
	The browser is the primary goal of the whole design, and the
	construct the most visible to the user. It is the point where
	all concept map, neuron and neuron type information come
	together, and with the addition of user interaction it becomes
	the starting point for the utilization of all the
	functionality in the Conzilla system.
      </para>
    </section>
    
    
    <section>

      <para>
	With the browser, we want to be able to do the following:
	<itemizedlist>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      View a concept map and all information supposed to be
	      displayed therein.
	    </para>
	  </listitem>
	  
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      Surf a neuron to arrive in its detailed map.
	    </para>
	  </listitem>
	
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      View the metadata of the neurons in the map.
	    </para>
	  </listitem>
	</itemizedlist>
      </para>

      <para>
	The responsability to sort, choose and display content is
	given to the <link linkend="ch-contentdisp">content displayer</link>.
      </para>
      
    </section>
    
    
    <section>

      <para>
	The browser consists of three principal layers:

	<itemizedlist>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      A module responsible for the graphics in the map. This
	      module will examine all information given in the
	      concept map, neurons, and neuron types and construct
	      graphical objects that operate independently of these
	      components. These objects localizes mouse- and keyclicks
	      and delegates them to interested listeners.
	    </para>
	  </listitem>

	  <listitem id="ch-browser-mapcontroller">
	    <para>
	      A map controller system, which is responsable for the
	      structures attached to a map, such as filters,
	      libraries and content viewers, and contains a general
	      interface for adding tools. It performs the
	      surfing actions, and emits history event accordingly.
	    </para>
	    
	    <para>
	      It also maintains the collection of maps defined by the
	      <link linkend="mapset">map set</link> of a map.
	    </para>
	  </listitem>

	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      The different tools and modules that use the above
	      layers to interact with the user.
	    </para>
	  </listitem>
	</itemizedlist>
      </para>
    </section>
    
    
    <section id="ch-browser-dd">
      <title>&s4;</title>
      <para>
	The three different layers are motivated by several wishes:
	<itemizedlist>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      The displaying module could be (and is) used in a
	      content viewer for viewing maps without being able to
	      surf them, or even for superposing maps.
	    </para>
	  </listitem>

	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      We will add tools not originally thought of. By forcing
	      all functionality to use the general interfaces, we
	      assure that they are usable to the needed
	      extent. By carefully separating responsability,
	      we ease the development of new features by allowing
	      experimentation without altering existing code.
	    </para>
	  </listitem>
	  
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      By separating the functionality from the user
	      interaction, we allow different implementations of the
	      user interfacing, which is an important part of the
	      project.
	    </para>
	  </listitem>
	</itemizedlist>
      </para>

      <para>
	We note that the implementation of <link linkend="mapset">map
	  sets</link> complicates the browser significantly, and we
	are not sure this will actually give much extra
	functionality. It is proposed that this functionality be
	removed. An alternative is discussed in <xref
	  linkend="ch-conceptmaps-dd"/>.
      </para>

      <para>
	Different ways of making concept maps more interactive have
	been discussed. There are several ways in which this may be
	possible:
	
	<itemizedlist>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      allow the user to move certain concepts inside the map, to
	      increase readability
	    </para>
	  </listitem>
	  
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      allow the user to hide parts of the concept-map
	      temporarily, to increase clarity
	    </para>
	  </listitem>
	</itemizedlist>
      </para>

      <para>
	This kind of functionality becomes even more important if we
	introduce automatically generated concept-maps, such as search
	results, and showing the result as a concept-map, or even
	included in the current concept-map. Being able to
	<quote>clean up</quote> the map would be a much wanted feature.
      </para>
