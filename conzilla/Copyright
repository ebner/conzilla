Conzilla is Copyrighted (C) 1999-2006  CID (http://cid.nada.kth.se/) 
under the terms of GPL, see the file gpl.txt for details.

(The KMR-group which is the developer and coordinator of Conzilla 
was previously a part of CID.)

We choose to use GPL for several reasons:
1) We want to hinder branching of the code base, making sure that all 
   contributions are given back to us for possible inclusion.
2) Conzilla is the result of research and since we belive that all research 
   results as well as the ongoing process of research should be inspectable 
   and verifyable (Open Research) we choose an open source license.
3) Since our funding is mainly from public institutions we belive that 
   everyone should have the right to make use of the results.
