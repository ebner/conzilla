# Conzilla - The Concept Browser

## Introduction

Being a Concept Browser means that Conzilla allows you to explore concepts and concept-relations in Context-maps. The concepts and concept-relations might have content as well as be described by metadata in some depth.

Individual concept and concept-relations may occur in several Context-maps. Consequently, Conzilla allows you to - given a individual concept or concept-relation - choose another Context-map where it occurs. There is also hyperlinks on concepts and concept-relations that can be followed.

Conzilla makes use of RDF for storing information about concepts, concept-relations as well as Context-maps. For those who have an technical interest, Conzilla can be used as a visualization tool for RDF.

See Conzillas homepage for an longer introduction to what Conzilla is and can do: [http://conzilla.org](http://conzilla.org/)

Conzilla is being developed by the Knowledge Management Research Group, see http://kmr.nada.kth.se. The development of Conzilla is to a large extent driven by research within Conceptual Modeling and user interface design for the Semantic Web.


## Running Conzilla

There are demos as well as a 'Conzilla online' section on the webpage. It uses the applet version of Conzilla2.

See the INSTALL document for how to install from the distribution or build from source.
