Requirements
------------
To run Conzilla you need to have at least java 1.4 installed.
If you run Conzilla in a browser it is sufficient with a java-plugin
(that supports java 1.4 obviously).


Installing from the distribution
--------------------------------
Unzip and go into the bin catalogue. There you find scripts that 
launches Conzilla, .bat on windows, .sh on Linux and other unixes 
including Mac OSX (*).


Compiling and running
---------------------
To compile from the CVS tree execute:
ant jar
ant scripts

Then go into the bin catalouge and execute the appropriate
run_conzilla script (.bat or .sh on Windows 
and various Unix flavours / MacOSX (*) respectively).


Compiling the distribution zip
------------------------------
Just run 'ant' and you will get the Conzilla.zip in the dist
directory. This zip will be self-contained and can be unpackaged
anywhere and then run with the scripts in bin.


Applet Conzilla
---------------
Run the following commands:
'ant jar'
'ant jar_all_dependencies_included'

Then, to sign the dist/Conzilla-all.jar you need a key. There is a
target in that you can modify with the appropriate keystorefile, alias
and storepass. Then run it with:
'ant sign_jar_all_dependencies_included'

The following applet code can be modified and pasted into a html-page:
<applet code="se.kth.cid.conzilla.app.ConzillaApplet"
        archive="path_to_jar_file/Conzilla-all.jar" 
	width="750"
	height="800" 
	name="conzilla">
  <param name="PROPERTYFILE" value="path_to_property_file/conzilla.properties">
  <param name="STARTMAP" value="fill_in_URI_of_map_to_launch">
  <param name="TARGETWINDOW" value="contentframe">
  <param name="CONTAINER" value="fill_in_URI_of_container_where_map_is_defined">
</applet>


(*) We have encountered a problem with running Conzilla from a
sh-scripts in Mac OSX 10.x. The locale does not seem to be set
correctly, hence add the following flag to the java command:
-Dfile.encoding=8859_1 
or whatever encoding you prefer/have on your system.
