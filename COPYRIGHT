Conzilla is copyrighted (c) 1999-2007
by KMR group at KTH (http://kmr.nada.kth.se/) under the terms
of the GPL, see the file GPL for details.

The KMR group which is the developer and coordinator of Conzilla 
was previously a part of CID at KTH.

We chose to use GPL for several reasons:
1) We want to hinder branching of the code base, making sure that all 
   contributions are given back to us for possible inclusion.
2) Conzilla is the result of research and since we believe that all research 
   results, as well as the ongoing process of research should be inspectable 
   and verifyable (Open Research) we chose an Open Source license.
3) Since we are mainly funded by public institutions we believe that 
   everyone should have the right to make use of the results.
